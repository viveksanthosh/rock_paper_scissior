This is a rock paper scissor game written with node/socket.io/typescript on the backend and react/socket.io on the client

To run the app:

1. install node 8 or higher
2. type "npm i" to install the server dependencies 
3. type "cd ./ui" and then type "npm i" to install the ui dependencies 
4. while still in the ui folder type "npm run build" to build the ui artifacts
5. then type "cd .." and the  npm start to srart the server
(Note: you may need to run this as a root user)
6. Enter the host host name and the ui will appear (it runs on port 80)
